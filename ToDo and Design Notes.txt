- Switch power on dust sensor (currently wakup and sleep is used). I do not know if that is sufficiently efficient.
- Overall power consumption

- packet scheduling / timing. Currently scheduling is as follows:
  Priority/Frequency Ratio   Description
  LOW                  1     Position (via LoRa-port 0x0B)
  MEDIUM               1     Vcc and Vbat (via LoRa-port 0x0C)
  HIGH                 10    Particle density, temperature and humidity (via LoRa-port 0x0A)

  Payloads are decoded in TTN, based on LoRa-ports
